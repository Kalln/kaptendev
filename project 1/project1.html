                This page is created with the help of JS and is the first website I made that used JS.<br><br>

                <strong>What it have done:</strong> I have created a function named hotel. The function recieves three paramters:
                name, rooms and booked (function(name, rooms, booked) ). The first one is telling the function what the property called name is supposed
                to have for value. In the first case it would be 'Park' (this.name = name). Thereafter the hotels number of rooms
                in total (this.rooms = rooms). Third one the booked amount of rooms (this.booked = booked). In the
                end this created (with the correct amount of entered paramters) a object.<br><br>

                I thereafter created another function that inside of the function described above that caluclates how
                many rooms are available in total. it returns the amount of rooms. <br><br>

                I then created the objects with the help of the created function that i described above. <br>
                <pre>
                <code>
                var Quay = new hotel('Quay', 40, 25);<br>
                var Park = new hotel('Park', 140, 77); <br><br>
                </code>
                </pre>

                I then replaced the values in the html with the help of this: <br>
                <code>
                var elName = document.getElementById('hotel_name');<br>
                elName.textContent = Park.name;<br><br>

                var elRooms = document.getElementById('hotel_rooms');<br>
                elRooms.textContent = Park.checkAvailability();<br><br>
                </code>

                And the same with the Quay hotel.<br><br>
                After all this I did the appropiete things with css to get the layout I wanted.
